							<h2>Tunnel of Laundry</h2>
							<p>This is the tunnel at Barringer hall where I lived last year. I lived on the left side of the hall and had to make the journey under this weather safe haven to do my laundry.</p>

							<h2>Secret Benny's</h2>
							<p>See this is the Benny's that nobody at Virginia Tech cares or knows about. See it peeking around the sign? My friends and I guarantee if you come here on a Saturday night the line will be non-existent.</p>

							<h2>Working 9 to 5</h2>
							<p>My classmate Anna working on the hallway floor before Philosophy class. Whenever looking at official VT pictures you would think everybody works diligently in the library. That's just not true, more students work while criss cross in a hallway than the entire library could fit.</p>

							<h2>The Past and the Future</h2>
							<p>I like the comparison in what once was and what will be. Biking around is now being replaced by credit card swiping e-scooters. Whether it's for the better only time will tell...probably won't be though.</p>

							<h2>Summer camp?</h2>
							<p>To be honest I don't even know which building this is attached to but I always walk under it to get to my classes. It has such a summer camp vibe and I love it, it's not a common look for the VT campus.</p>
